## Iteration 0	

 * Start date: Monday January 29th 2018
 * End date: Monday February 5th

## Process

We’ve decided on using the Scrum development framework for now, as it is widely used in industry. The effectiveness of this process for our group will become clearer as we move forward with the project.

#### Roles & responsibilities

So far, roles are uniform in decision making, and no development has yet started. We will need to pick a Scrum Master potentially. 

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team. 

Scrum as our initial framework tool for developing our software.
Github Projects. It is a board used to create cards, can be linked to issues and assigned members. Used for task assignment and tracking progress .
Discord as our main platform for communication between team members when not in person.
Google Doc currently as our main tool for collaborative work for now, may change in the future.
Android as the platform we are currently aiming to develop for.

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Goals for this iteration are decision based due to lack of development in this cycle.
Pick out one of multiple ideas we had for application we plan to work on
Must discuss and make a decision based on what we discussed and what we aim to do in this course.
Organize meeting schedule and improve communications
Discussion and decision about the applications we are using, the times we are avaliable, how we can best communicate with each other.
Complete product.md
Decide key ideas about the application’s features
Discussion about what we want to implement, what our core application will do and what else we want the application to do.
Finalize the actual target audience as well as the problem it solves for them
Discussion about the application we are making is well-defined, otherwise consider a different angle, implementation, or even the entire product.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

Mock ups of how screens may look (Done)
Since the design of the app is very important to how we want the app to feel, and it will greatly affect the “flow” of the app’s use, we want to make sure we know how the layout will look
Presenting goals and users via user stories in development (In development)
Our audience is quite specific and niche, which allows us to create even more specific hypothetical users and situations to address. Broad user stories are unhelpful, but our project can leverage the specificity of user stories in conjunction with Scrum to make sure we all have a good grasp on what our goals are each sprint.
