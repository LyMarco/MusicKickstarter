#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a mobile app that helps guide musicians by centralizing their songwriting and creative process. The problem that we are aiming to solve is the issue when a musician suddenly has a breakthrough or idea for a musical composition and they do not have a centralized place to record their ideas, and expand on them through lyrics, song outlining, and optional idea suggestions. In today’s day and age, most people carry around a smartphone, and having an app to assist this process would be the most accessible way to keep an idea from escaping.

Core Features:
Sound recording for doing takes
Section to write lyrics and chords
Optional lyric suggestions such as rhyming and common words. 
Metronome
Virtual instruments playing chords/notes (loopable)
Notes/reminders section

Potential Extended Features:
Cloud sharing option for sharing notes (this method would have to be a publish/immutable result)
Dictionary/Thesaurus look-up section
Auto-scroll timed feature for lyrics while recording
Changeable font for lyrics/notes section
Chord suggestion (harmonization)


 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?


Our focus will be more on users who have at least some exposure to making music and the creative process. We aim to help these users who have had a breakthrough musical idea with nowhere to record and develop it. These are users who want to make music, but need a convenient tool to preserve and develop a new idea or breakthrough for a song. Moreover, these are also users that are experiencing writer’s block. These users are stuck, and need creative suggestions in order to progress. Based on lyrics already written, the application will suggest how to continue the song, and differentiate by genre and mood.

A common use is like this scenario: An fairly-experienced singer-songwriter named Billy Bob is walking through the park when suddenly he gets a great composition idea for a song. However, the issue is that he has too many separate apps for recording audio/takes, writing notes/lyrics, and none of those apps help facilitate or enhance the creative process

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

http://blog.sonicbids.com/top-6-must-have-apps-for-songwriters 


Current applications that are used by songwriters in the early stages of a song’s conception include notepads or voice recorders like their default applications or something like Evernote. The problem with these applications is that they’re not tailored for musicians, so voice recordings are not differentiated by different versions/takes of the same verse, and they don’t aid the creative process whatsoever, merely providing a platform to record.

Other applications that might be competitive include Songwriter Pad on IOS, but their application has very poor reviews for their intrusive ads and unintuitive/messy interface design. We plan to structure our app to make it much smoother and cleaner to go from the conception of an idea to the recording and development of the idea. For instance, the very first thing you should be able to see and do in our application is immediately record a sample of the melody in your head, then possible lyrics from that sample. In contrast, Songwriter Pad is concerned about things like the number of verses and the title of the song, which naturally occur much later during the creative process. This product aims to help provide a more natural setting in which music creation occurs, and will be specific to music creators, which is why our audience will prefer and find our application useful.

 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)

### Highlights

 * Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product plan.
Mobile application
Alternatives: Website, Browser App, Desktop App
General experience with app development specifically is low, so the interest was in an in-depth, large-scale project to sink one’s teeth into and gain experience
Comfortability with Java, leading to Android development in particular
Benefits:
Combine audio recording, lyric note taking, and suggestions into one simple app, which are usually features of multiple different apps. This is a single process yet most users need to use multiple apps to accomplish their goal.
In the moment recording and help. Great ideas can occur at any moment, and yet fade away quickly if not recorded. This app allows you to capture every single one of them
Prevent Writer’s Block. With the ability to play instruments inside the app, and to get varied lyrics suggestions, allows users to push on with their creative process and overcome obstacles.
Alternative Ideas: Activity suggestion app
It would gather a user’s interests, such as types of food, sports, hobbies, etc. and give a daily suggestion for somewhere to go based on the user’s location. For example if there was a discount at a nearby rock climbing place, and the user showed that they like extreme sports, it would give that suggestion. Another goal of the app would be to try user’s to try new things outside of their interests. The app would be slightly gamified, where users would gain points for trying out suggestions, and more points for trying things outside their interests. Overall we did not choose this idea as it was difficult to narrow down the target audience, and the exact functionality of the app. It was a good idea but lacked clarity, and we needed something we could focus on better.
