# Team 11

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 8:00pm Feb. 6
 * Where: BA 1210

## Process - Reflection

Scrum as a preliminary process was a unanimous decision. Open to change if we hit too many difficulties using it.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

The process to decide upon an idea, once the ideas were established, was efficient, and such decision-making is what we’re looking for moving forward.
Discord worked well, everyone joined quickly and was able to be in the call
Timing of Meeting works well
Each individual was able to attend concurrently. Participation in discussion was fairly equal throughout


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

Initial speed of decision-making and idea formulation was relatively slow, will hopefully be smoother as our ideas become more solidified and our communication processes are smoother (Discord for online meetings etc.) We should not allow the speed of the decision/inception process reflect the speed of the development and review process. 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


No changes in process.

## Product - Review

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


Successfully decided on the app to aid the Musical Creative Process
Identified our audience as relatively experienced musicians/songwriters who have the beginnings to a song idea and need a platform to help them grow it.
Everyone has come onto Discord for meetings to discuss Deliverable 1
Split ideas between Core and Optional features we would like to implement
Audio recordings and primary lyric suggestions are two very important features
Periphery features include chord suggestion, more complex lyric suggestions based on themes or keywords

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

Development has not yet started, so all tasks were focused on deliberation and decision-making.
Scrum Master was not yet chosen due to general problems with indecision. This indicates that swift deliberation and assignment of roles is necessary, and all individuals should have input.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Discord and Google Docs are working well for planning and meetings, need to just get everyone a little more accustomed to using discord.
Also need to ensure regular attendance to meetings on Discord (1 in-person meeting, 1 online meeting per week ideally. Occasionally supplement online meetings to in-person when necessary and feasible)
Definitely want to start using Github Projects (Board) to organize tasks and track progress, creating Scrum Boards
Started breaking down high level features into smaller features, and then tasks immediately. This is the likely the top priority task for the next iteration


 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
